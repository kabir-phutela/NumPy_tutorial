This repository contains a comprehensive NumPy tutorial and hands-on practice implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project is to understand NumPy arrays, attributes, and functions in depth, with clear examples and explanations.



It covers array creation, indexing, reshaping, sorting, mathematical operations, axis-based computation, and advanced NumPy utilities commonly used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing.
