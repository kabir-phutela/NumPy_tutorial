WHAT IS NumPy ?
* It stands for Numperical python and it is used for peforming fast calculations and scientific operations.
* It provides a powerful data structure called ndarray (N-dimensional array), which allows efficient storage
  and manipulation of large amounts of numerical data.
How is Numpy better than python lists?
* speed efficient - since lists uses loops for operation execution whereas numpy is built using C language allowing
  it perform operations faster than lists
* Memory efficent - Lists stored refernce to the object whereas numpy stores the object in-place . 


This repository contains a comprehensive NumPy tutorial and hands-on practice implemented using Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project is to understand NumPy arrays, attributes, and functions in depth, with clear examples and explanations.

It covers array creation, indexing, reshaping, sorting, mathematical operations, axis-based computation, and advanced NumPy utilities commonly used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing.
